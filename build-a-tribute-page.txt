       <h3 id="headline">Timeline of Elisabet Sobecks life</h3>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>2020</strong> - On March 11th, 2020 Elisabet Sobeck was born in the suburbs of Carson City, Nevada.</li>
         <li> 
           <strong>2026</strong> - When Elisabet was 6 years old, she accidentally set fire to a pine tree in her backyard while playing with a children's electronics kit. After the fire department arrived and put out the fire, her mom showed her the remaids of baby chicks the fire had killed. Elisabet said she didn't care, but her mother told her that if she didn't use her intelligence and talents to better the world then they would mean nothing. This lesson stuck with Sobeck and ultimately led to her alturistic philosophy.  
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>2033 - 2036</strong> - Elisabet enrolled in Stanford University at age 13 and graduated at 16 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Experimental Physics.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>2036 - 2040</strong> - Elisabet also earned her Doctorate of Philosophy in Robotics from Carnegie-Mellon University.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>2040</strong> - Within a year of her graduation, Elisabet was hired by Ted Faro, the worlds first trillionaire and the founder, owner and chairman of the robotics and technology corporation Faro Automated Solutions.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>2040 - 2042</strong> - Within 2 years of working at the company, she was promoted to the position of Chief Scientist of the company.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>2040 - 2048</strong> - Over the next 8 years of getting hired at the company, her work in the design and development of "green robots" led to the company being in the lead in manufacturing technology that minimized and reversed damage to the environment the effects of climate change. 
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>2048</strong> - Elisabet resigned from the company after becoming disgusted at Faro's decision to take the company into the military automatation market. She continued her work in green robot technology, starting her own sucessful environmental technology company Miriam Technologies.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>October 2064</strong> - In spite of plaguing Sobeck with many lawsuits due to seeing her company as a competitor to his companies environmental division, Faro contacted Sobeck for help after his military robots had gone rouge. However, Sobeck came to the conclusion that the robots were now self-serving entities that would overtake the planet and destroy all biomass on the planet within 15 months.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>Late 2064 - Early 2065</strong> - Aware that any attempt to stop the swarm was futile, Sobeck devised a plan with an altogether different objective called Project: Zero Dawn. However, in order for there to be enough time to implement Zero Dawn, the doomed global human populace would have to sacrifice itself in a futile effort to stop the swarm in order to slow its advance. Utmost secrecy would therefore be required to hide the truth and keep the global populace fighting.
         </li>
         <li>
           <strong>January 2066</strong> - Elisabet sacraficed herself to protect Project: Zero Dawn and prevent the permanent extinction of humanity.
         </li>
